# Blåhaj Holder for Your Monitor  

Currently a work in progress—just like all of us. I update this project whenever I find the time. Feel free to use it however you like (as long as it's not for anything evil). Blåhajs are not evil! ...Or are they? No, no, of course not. Right?  

## Have You Ever Found Yourself in This Situation?  
You're at work, about to do some coding, when your mind begins to drift. The stress of an unusually high workload weighs on you, and suddenly, you're thinking about your next vacation. When would be a good time to take it? Where should you go? Are you going to travel alone again? Is Morocco even safe enough for solo travel? Wait... why did you just think about Morocco?  

You lean back in your chair, lost in thought. When was the last time you swam in the ocean?  

Ah yes, the ocean. That vast, blue, peaceful—yet terrifying—expanse. Home to some of the most majestic creatures on our planet. Sharks.  

Your gaze shifts to the side, where your Blåhaj sits beside your PC. You remember the day you bought it at IKEA, somewhere between the bookshelves and the meatballs. But now, there it lies, helpless on its side, staring into the void. Or maybe... staring into your soul?  

A pang of guilt washes over you. This noble shark deserves better. But how?  

Then, suddenly—the perfect idea strikes.  

## The Blåhaj Holder for Your Monitor  

Now, your shark can rest comfortably on top of your monitor, watching over you like the wise and noble creature it is. A conveniently placed hexagonal hole (because hexagons are the bestagons) ensures proper ventilation.  

Your Blåhaj finally has a purpose. Or maybe... it always did?  

Perhaps it was never just a plush shark. Perhaps, all this time, it has been waiting for you to realize its true destiny. A silent guardian, an ever-present companion, witnessing your struggles, your triumphs, your endless debugging sessions.  

And now, perched atop your monitor, it has found its place in the world. A higher purpose. A vantage point from which it can oversee your work, your daydreams, your existential crises about whether you should switch careers and move to a remote cabin in the mountains.  

Does it judge you? No. It simply watches. Patient. Understanding. Always there.  

And in those moments, when the weight of life presses down on you, when the code refuses to compile, when the coffee grows cold—you look up.  

And you see it.  

Blåhaj.  

Watching.  

Waiting.  

Being.
